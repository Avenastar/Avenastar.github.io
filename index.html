            <p> the day is approaching. a day where evil lays dead and bloody at my feet. I'll feel their bones crunch in my hands and watch the life drain from their eyes. Evil demons, bullies, doesn't matter what I shall tear their throats out and slaughter them like cattle. But they are not innocent. I will look them in the eye and recount their sins as their intestines are plucked from their body. The day approaches.
